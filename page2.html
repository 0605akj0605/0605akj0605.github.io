  <p> So,you might be wondering why I got started with this. It can be due to a host o reasons-The fact that I watched "The Social Network"
 recently and liked the idea of having a personal blog or I am too furstrated by Instagram's algorithm or just because
 I want a miniscule individual presence on the Digital Universe. Whatever the reason may be,I am excited to work on this.
 Let's see if this becomes yet another project which I abandon after some time or it lasts forever or somewhere in between the two extremes
 I have suggested.That's something I guess only time can tell.
